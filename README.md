## Conclusion



Creating SnapShare was an incredible journey that significantly boosted my learning curve. Throughout the development process, I encountered numerous bugs and challenges, especially related to cookies, Cloudinary, and state management. Sometimes, it took an entire day to solve even a minor bug. However, every problem had a solution, and with persistence and determination, I eventually resolved each issue. This project has not only enhanced my technical skills but also taught me the importance of perseverance and problem-solving in software development.
